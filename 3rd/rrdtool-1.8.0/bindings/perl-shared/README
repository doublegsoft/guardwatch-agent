These are the Perl bindings for rrdtool as a shared library. To compile do
the following:

perl Makefile.PL
make test

For Windows Users, make sure you have the following requirements:

- ActiveState Perl (32bit version Only)
  Remark: Using MSVC, the last supported ActivePerl version is 5.16,
  e.g. ActivePerl-5.16.3.1604-MSWin32-x86-298023.msi
  Since 5.18, ActivePerl is compiled with GCC compilers, and Microsoft
  toolchains are *not* compatible
- Microsoft Visual C++
- The following binaries in your path: mt.exe, nmake.exe, link.exe, perl.exe
- Make the project rrdlib.vcproj in Release mode to create rrdlib.lib

To build:

perl Makefile.PL
nmake

To Install:

nmake install

NOTE: If using anything other than Visual C++ 9, edit Makefile.PL and modify
      your paths appropriately.
